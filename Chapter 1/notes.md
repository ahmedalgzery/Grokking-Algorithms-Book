# Intorduction To Algorithms

* #### Algorithms: is a set of instructions for completint tasks

-------

* ### What is Binary-Search mean ?
  * ##### is an algorithms that it's input is a sorted list of elements. And if this element I search about is there, the binary search will return its position and if not, binary search will return null  

-------
* ### But, How I can use binary search and Why?
  * ##### For example: If you have a list of 1000 numbers and wanna find any number, what will you do? You may start search with the first element in the list until you find your number..... But you can do in another simple way (binary-search) : You can divide this list into 2 parts then take the part(has a number you search) and divide it into 2 parts agin and so on until you reach you number ...
  * ##### You can use binary search to limit you search time and memory you use 
  * ##### You can use O(log~2~n) instead of O(n);
